- 👋 Hi, I’m @ForgotMyCode

I do primarily Java, C/C++ and Python.

Welcome, whoever you are, have a cookie 🍪. Seriously. Mental illnesses such as not liking cookies are not acceptable here.

Was the cookie good?
a) yes  b) yes  c) yes  d) I'm leaving involuntarily

Cool, get another 🍪.

As you can see I am a completely respectable human being that gives cookies to strangers.

If you are seeking for a life advice:

Commit & Push your brain regularly so you don't forget everything like me.

Don't get used to the snacks here, it's your turn to bring some.
